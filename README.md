# Kiosk Point Of Sale
This is intended to function as some sort of simple inventory tracking system based on [Meteor](meteor.com), intended for stores about as complex as the kiosk at your pool. It barely does anything, but it has two ranked levels of trust and some simple stats about revenue and profit.

# Using the kiosk
Define default passwords for the admin account (and they can't be changed later). Install Meteor on a fitting server, use `meteor bundle` and run.

#Contributing
Do whatever the heck you want. If you have a pull request with just about anything worth adding I'll accept it.
